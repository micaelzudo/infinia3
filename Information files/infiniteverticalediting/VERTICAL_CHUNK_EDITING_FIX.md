# Vertical Chunk Editing Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix terrain editing at vertical chunk boundaries.

## Overview of Changes

1. **Extended Raycast Box**
   - Increased the height of the raycast box to cover 3 chunks vertically
   - Repositioned the box to start from the bottom of the current chunk
   - Added a debug button to visualize the raycast box

2. **PlayerEditMask Propagation**
   - Added special handling for vertical boundaries in noiseMapEditor_debug.ts
   - Ensured playerEditMasks are properly created and updated for all affected chunks
   - Added code to propagate edits to neighboring chunks at vertical boundaries

3. **Boundary Triangle Emission Logic**
   - Modified the isTrulyOpenBoundaryTriangle function to better handle vertical boundaries
   - Added explicit handling for bottom boundary (Y-)
   - Improved top boundary (Y+) handling to work regardless of neighbor existence

4. **Neighbor Awareness**
   - Added playerEditMask flags to neighborFlags in regenerateAffectedMeshes
   - Ensured proper neighbor flags are passed to the mesh generator

5. **Data Structure Updates**
   - Created IsolatedChunkData interface with playerEditMask support
   - Updated all chunk creation code to include playerEditMask

## How to Test the Fixes

1. Run the application and load the isolated terrain viewer
2. Click the "Show Raycast Box" button to visualize the extended editing area
3. Edit terrain near vertical chunk boundaries to verify that edits work properly
4. Use the "Show Boundary Edges" button to visualize chunk boundaries and check for gaps

## Technical Details

### Extended Raycast Box

The raycast box has been extended to cover three chunks vertically:

```typescript
const boxGeometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(
    CHUNK_SIZE, 
    CHUNK_HEIGHT * 3, // Extend to include chunks above and below
    CHUNK_SIZE
);
raycastBoxMesh.position.set(
    ISOLATED_CHUNK_X * CHUNK_SIZE, 
    ISOLATED_CHUNK_Y * CHUNK_HEIGHT, // Position at bottom of current chunk
    ISOLATED_CHUNK_Z * CHUNK_SIZE 
);
```

### PlayerEditMask Propagation

Special handling was added for vertical boundaries:

```typescript
// Special handling for vertical boundaries
if (targetMapY === 0 || targetMapY === CHUNK_HEIGHT - 1) {
    // We're at a vertical boundary, make sure to update the neighboring chunk's mask
    const vertNeighborChunkY = targetMapY === 0 ? targetChunkY - 1 : targetChunkY + 1;
    const vertNeighborKey = getChunkKeyY(targetChunkX, vertNeighborChunkY, targetChunkZ);
    
    // Create or get the neighbor's edit mask
    let vertNeighborMask = modifiedPlayerEditMasks[vertNeighborKey];
    // ... (code to create/update the neighbor's mask)
    
    // Update the neighbor's edit mask at the boundary
    const neighborY = targetMapY === 0 ? CHUNK_HEIGHT - 1 : 0;
    vertNeighborMask[targetMapX][neighborY][targetMapZ] = true;
}
```

### Boundary Triangle Emission Logic

The boundary triangle emission logic was improved:

```typescript
// Handle vertical boundaries more consistently
// Top boundary (Y+) - always check both conditions regardless of neighbor existence
if (y === CHUNK_HEIGHT-1 && isYBoundary) {
  if (!shouldEmitTopBoundaryMesh(x, y, z)) return false;
  if (!shouldEmitBoundaryMesh(x, y, z, '+Y')) return false;
}

// Bottom boundary (Y-) - add explicit handling
if (y === 0 && isYBoundary) {
  if (!shouldEmitBoundaryMesh(x, y, z, '-Y')) return false;
}
```

### Neighbor Awareness

Added playerEditMasks to neighborFlags:

```typescript
const neighborFlags = {
    neighborXPosExists: !!noiseMapXPos,
    // ... other neighbor flags
    // Add playerEditMasks for all neighbors
    playerEditMaskXPos: isolatedLoadedChunkData[getChunkKeyY(chunkX + 1, chunkY, chunkZ)]?.playerEditMask || null,
    // ... other playerEditMask flags
};
```

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Corner Cases**: While the current implementation handles most boundary cases, there might still be issues at corners where three chunks meet.

2. **Performance**: The additional checks and propagation logic might impact performance slightly. Consider optimizing if needed.

3. **Diagonal Neighbors**: For perfect corner handling, diagonal neighbors might be needed. The current implementation only uses the six direct neighbors.

## Future Improvements

1. **Adaptive Resolution**: Consider implementing adaptive resolution for more detailed terrain near the player.

2. **Optimized Boundary Handling**: Further optimize boundary handling by pre-computing boundary information.

3. **Seamless LOD Transitions**: Implement level-of-detail transitions that maintain seamless boundaries.
